Hi my name is EpicRangeTime and welcome to the Epic Range. Time. Something something crappy joke.

Here's how to install my mod
1. Place the zip file in the folder [SPT Folder]/User/Mods
2. Right click on the zip folder and click one of the following things
-If you are using WinZip click "Extract Here"
-If you are using Peazip, access the Peazip dropdown and select "Extract Here"
-Not sure what 7zip looks like but most software will have some variation of "Extract Here"
3. Enjoy!

Alternatively you can just open the zip file and drag the folder contained inside to your mods directory, contained within your user folder.
In the end don't let me think for you, I include these instructions for people who actually don't know how to do these things.

Please do not redistribute this mod or any assets that are in this mod without first asking permission from me, EpicRangeTime.

Credit for this mod can be given in part to GroovyPenguinX, Tron, and Pettan for helping me figure out how to use blender, how to use Unity, and how to package files properly. I would have never got here if not for them. Thank you.
