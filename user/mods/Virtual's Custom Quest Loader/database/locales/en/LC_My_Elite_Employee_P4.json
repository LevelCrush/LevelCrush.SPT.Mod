  "LC_EVENT_4 description": "Hello Mercenary! A little birdy told me that the mall off the interchange got a restock from Terragroup. The shelves are filled with food and the stores are just bursting with things for those with sticky fingers to grab. I think its a load of hogwash. If thats the case the place would be absolutely crawling with lowlifes like me! Do you think you can check it out for me? Just pop off a yellow flare at the power substation, if the rumors are true and maybe thin the herd a bit. Nothing crazy just a couple bodies in a corner to mark our claim. ( SWAG + Donuts is recommended to be set to Live Like)",
