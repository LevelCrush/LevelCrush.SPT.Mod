  "LC_EVENT_4 description": "Thank you for coming. This shopping mall busy has been messy, but you have been very impressive to say the least. However it seems a client of mine is using this as an opportunity. Unfortunately I will not divulge their identity but i will tell you they were looking for a special laptop. I was unable to locate it quickly enough, and it seems my client has hired additional help. This is bad for business. Search for this laptop. You are more than welcome to check the stores but it is likely hidden. Perhaps Killa nabbed it before you injured them. Regardless search high and low. Report back to me when you get it or have exhausted all avenues.",
